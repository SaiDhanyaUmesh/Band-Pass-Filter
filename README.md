# Band-Pass Filter Circuit

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a **Band-Pass Filter** that allows signals within a specific frequency range to pass while attenuating frequencies outside this range. The circuit is designed using **active components** to achieve the desired filtering characteristics.

## Objectives
- Design an active bandpass filter using operational amplifiers for high precision and performance.
- Achieve a high Quality Factor (Q-Factor) to ensure a sharp frequency response.
- Design a differential amplifier to be used in the bandpass filter for enhanced signal amplification, reduction of common-mode noise and improved performance in high-frequency applications.

### Results
| Parameter                  | Value  |
|----------------------------|--------|
| Center Frequency (fc)      | 1 MHz  |
| Lower Cutoff Frequency (fL)| 950 kHz|
| Upper Cutoff Frequency (fH)| 1.05 MHz |
| Bandwidth (BW)            | 100 kHz |

## Future Improvements
-  Implement the filter in a real-world circuit and compare experimental results with
 theoretical values.
- Optimize component values for improved selectivity and gain.
- Analyze the filterâ€™s response with different load conditions.
- Investigate the impact of temperature variations on filter performance.
